## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Risk

These keys provide access to your Supabase project and should be treated as confidential. Anyone with these keys could potentially:
- Access and modify your database
- Execute administrative operations
- Compromise your application's data

## üîß Immediate Actions Required

   - Log in to your Supabase dashboard at https://app.supabase.com/
   - Navigate to Project Settings ‚Üí API
   - Click "Regenerate" next to each compromised key
   - Update your `.env` file with the new keys

2. **Update Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # In your .env file, update these values:
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://dcfavnetfqirooxhvqsy.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_new_anon_key_here
   ```

3. **Verify Application Functionality**:
   - Test that your application still works with the new keys
   - Run `npm run test:supabase` to verify connectivity

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices for Key Management

1. **Never share keys in chat or code repositories**
2. **Use environment variables for all secrets**
3. **Regularly rotate keys (every 6-12 months)**
4. **Use different keys for different environments**
