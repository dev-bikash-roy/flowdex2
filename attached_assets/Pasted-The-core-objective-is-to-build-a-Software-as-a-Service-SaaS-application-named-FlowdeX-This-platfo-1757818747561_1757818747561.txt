The core objective is to build a Software as a Service (SaaS) application named FlowdeX. This platform will serve as a trading journal and backtesting tool for financial traders. The functionality and user experience should closely replicate the reference platform, app.traderscasa.com, but with the unique FlowdeX branding.
The application will be developed using the following technology stack:
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js with Express.js
Database: PostgreSQL
APIs & Services: Stripe (for payments), TwelveData (for market data), and AWS S3 (for file storage).
Key Features to Be Developed:
Feature Area
Key Functionalities
Branding & UI/UX
Implement the FlowdeX logo and a sleek, dark theme with blue/grey accents. The interface must be professional, responsive, and intuitive.
Backtesting & Replay
Allow users to upload historical data (CSV) or connect to data APIs (TwelveData) to replay market scenarios. This includes replay controls (play, pause, speed) and various chart types.
Manual Trading
Enable simulated trading directly on the chart replay, with features to track open positions, PnL, and trade history.
Trading Journal
Automatically log all trades. Users can add manual notes, attach screenshots, and apply strategy or psychology tags. The journal will be exportable to CSV and PDF.
Analytics Dashboard
Provide users with in-depth performance metrics, including an equity curve, win rate, profit factor, and heatmaps showing performance by time and day.
User Accounts & Subscriptions
Standard user authentication (signup, login, password reset, 2FA). A subscription model managed via Stripe will offer different tiers (e.g., Free and Pro).
Development Plan & Milestones
The project is broken down into four distinct phases, which provides a clear and logical roadmap for development:
Phase 1: Core Replay & Trading
Focus on building the heart of the application: the chart replay engine.
Integrate with TwelveData for market data.
Develop the manual trading interface on the chart.
Phase 2: Journal & Analytics
Implement the automatic trading journal.
Build the analytics dashboard with key performance charts and statistics.
Phase 3: Accounts & Payments
Develop the user authentication system (signup, login, etc.).
Integrate Stripe for handling subscriptions and payments.
Create an admin dashboard for user management.
Phase 4: Final Polish & Deployment
Refine the branding and user interface.
Deploy the application to a production environment (e.g., Vercel/AWS).
Finalize documentation and prepare for handover.
