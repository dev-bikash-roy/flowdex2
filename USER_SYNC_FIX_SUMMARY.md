# User Synchronization Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

Users created through `supabase.auth.signUp()` were not appearing in the custom `users` table in Supabase, even though they were successfully created in Supabase's internal authentication system.

## Root Cause

There was no mechanism to automatically synchronize users from Supabase Auth to the custom `users` table. When users signed up, they were only added to the `auth.users` table, not to the application's custom `users` table.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`supabase_schema.sql`)

Added database triggers and functions to automatically sync new users:

- Created `handle_new_user()` function that inserts new users into the custom `users` table
- Created `on_auth_user_created` trigger that calls the function when new users are created
- The function extracts user metadata (first name, last name) and stores it in the custom table
- Added `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` statements to prevent conflicts with existing policies

### 2. Test and Sync Scripts

Created two new scripts to help with user synchronization:

- `test_user_sync.ts`: Verifies that users are properly synced between auth system and custom table
- `sync_users.ts`: Manually syncs existing users from auth system to custom table

### 3. Package.json Updates

Added new npm scripts for running the test and sync operations:

- `test:user-sync`: Runs the user synchronization test
- `sync:users`: Runs the user synchronization script

## How to Apply the Fix

1. **Apply the updated schema**:
   - Copy the updated `supabase_schema.sql` content
   - Run it in your Supabase SQL editor
   - The script now handles existing policies gracefully

2. **Test the synchronization**:
   - Create a new user through your signup form
   - Run `npm run test:user-sync` to verify the user appears in both systems

3. **Sync existing users** (if needed):
   - Run `npm run sync:users` to sync all existing users

## Verification

After applying these changes:
- New users created through signup will automatically appear in your custom `users` table
- Existing users can be synced manually using the provided script
- Both auth system and custom table will have consistent user data

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors when running the SQL script:

1. **Policy already exists errors**: The updated script now drops existing policies first
2. **Permission errors**: Make sure you're running the script as a user with sufficient privileges
3. **Function already exists**: The script uses `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` to handle this

## Future Considerations

1. The sync function only handles basic user information (ID, email, first name, last name)
2. If you need to sync additional user metadata, update the `handle_new_user()` function
3. Consider adding similar triggers for user updates and deletions if needed
