# Chart Endpoint Fix

## Problem

The frontend was getting a 500 Internal Server Error when trying to fetch chart data from `http://localhost:5000/api/chart-data?symbol=EURUSD&interval=1h&limit=100`. This was caused by issues in the TwelveData service initialization.

## Root Cause

1. The TwelveData service was throwing an error during initialization when the `TWELVEDATA_API_KEY` environment variable was not properly loaded or validated
2. The dynamic import error handling in the routes file was not robust enough to catch all possible errors
3. The chart data endpoint did not have sufficient fallback mechanisms

## Solution

### 1. Updated TwelveData Service (`server/services/twelveDataService.ts`)

- Modified the service to only initialize the TwelveData client if the API key is provided
- Added proper error handling for client initialization
- Added checks in all service functions to verify the client is available before making requests
- Made the service gracefully degrade to error states rather than throwing initialization errors

### 2. Updated Routes File (`server/routes.ts`)

- Enhanced error handling in the chart data endpoint
- Added try-catch blocks around TwelveData API calls
- Improved fallback to mock data when TwelveData service fails
- Added better logging for debugging purposes
- Improved dynamic import error handling

### 3. Added Test Script

- Created `test_chart_endpoint.ts` to verify the fix
- Added npm script `test:chart` to package.json

## How to Test the Fix

1. Restart your server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Test the chart endpoint directly:
   ```bash
   npm run test:chart
   ```

3. Or test via curl:
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:5000/api/chart-data?symbol=EURUSD&interval=1h&limit=100"
   ```

## Expected Behavior

- The endpoint should now return a 200 OK response with chart data
- If TwelveData API key is valid and service is working, real market data will be returned
- If TwelveData service is not available, mock data will be returned instead
- No more 500 Internal Server Errors

## Verification

After applying the fix:
1. The frontend should be able to fetch chart data without errors
2. Chart components should display data properly
3. No more console errors about failed chart data requests
