# Backtest UI Improvements Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Backtest.tsx Component
- Modified the "Play" button to directly show the advanced chart instead of the basic chart
- Implemented URL parameter handling to automatically show the advanced chart when accessing `/backtest/session/{id}`
- Added browser back/forward navigation support
- Added proper cleanup when exiting a session

### 2. AdvancedBacktestChart.tsx Component
- Fixed TypeScript errors with lightweight-charts API usage
- Updated series creation to use the correct API methods
- Added proper error handling and fallback to mock data
- Improved chart initialization with null checks
- Fixed indicator rendering (Moving Average, RSI)

## Key Features Implemented

### URL Routing
- Users can now access a specific session directly via `/backtest/session/{id}`
- The URL automatically updates when selecting a session
- Browser navigation (back/forward) is properly handled

### Direct Advanced Chart Access
- Clicking the "Play" button now directly opens the advanced chart interface
- No need to first open the basic chart and then switch to advanced

### Improved Chart Functionality
- Real data fetching with fallback to mock data
- Proper error handling for API failures
- Correct implementation of technical indicators
- Responsive chart that adapts to window resizing

## How It Works

1. User creates or selects a backtest session
2. User clicks the "Play" button (which now directly opens the advanced chart)
3. The URL updates to `/backtest/session/{session-id}`
4. The advanced chart interface is displayed with playback controls
5. Users can navigate using browser back/forward buttons
6. Clicking "Exit Session" returns to the main backtest page

## Files Modified

- `client/src/pages/Backtest.tsx`
- `client/src/components/AdvancedBacktestChart.tsx`

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Navigate to the Backtest page
2. Create a new session or select an existing one
3. Click the "Play" button - this should now directly open the advanced chart
4. Verify that the URL updates to include the session ID
5. Test browser back/forward navigation
6. Test the "Exit Session" button to return to the main page
7. Verify that direct URL access to `/backtest/session/{id}` works correctly
