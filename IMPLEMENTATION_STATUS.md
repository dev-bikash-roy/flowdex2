# FlowdeX Implementation Status

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication and Signup Issues
✅ **Fixed**: Database column name mismatch (camelCase vs snake_case)
- Updated server/localAuth.ts to properly map fields
- Updated server/storage.ts to handle column name mapping
- Updated shared/schema.ts to maintain proper TypeScript types

✅ **Fixed**: Missing `/api/auth/user` endpoint
- Added endpoint to retrieve current user information
- Fixed response format in signup and login endpoints

✅ **Fixed**: Type mapping between client and server
- Ensured consistent field naming throughout the application

### 2. Database Connection Issues
✅ **Fixed**: Environment variable loading order
- Updated server/db.ts to load dotenv before other imports

## Remaining Setup Requirements

### Database Setup
To fully resolve all issues and get the application working, you need to:

1. **Install PostgreSQL locally**:
   - Download from: https://www.postgresql.org/download/
   - Follow installation instructions for Windows
   - Remember the password for the postgres user

2. **Create the flowdex database**:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE flowdex;
   ```

3. **Update your `.env` file**:
   Change the DATABASE_URL to point to your local PostgreSQL instance:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/flowdex
   ```

4. **Run database schema migration**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

### Alternative: Use the existing NeonDB connection
If you prefer to use the existing NeonDB connection in the .env file, you need to ensure the database schema is properly set up:

1. **Run the database push command**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

## Testing the Fixes

After completing the database setup:

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the signup page and try creating a new account

The signup should now work without the "column does not exist" error, and the 401 unauthorized errors should be resolved.
